# 📝 Journal Metadata Formatter

This app streamlines the process of digitizing the metadata associated with my journal entries into a Markdown based solution.

## 📚 Why I Built This App

As someone who loves the kinesthetics of writing by hand, I've spilled a lot of ink writing in my journal. On the other hand, as someone who loves data, I know the end destination for my rambly journal entries must be a database. The first step down that road is transcription.

I knew I wanted to depend on markdown (and I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)), but reliably typing out the metadata of each entry is a tedious ritual. That frustration compromises data fidelity and discourages me from regularly transcribing entries.

That's where the Journal Metadata Formatter comes in! By automating the formatting process, this app reduces the fuss and ensures I can focus on what truly matters: capturing my thoughts and reflections.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Input:** Enter journal entry details into the app.
2. **Metadata Generation:** The app automatically formats the metadata according to a predefined and versioned structure.
3. **Copy and Paste:** With the formatted metadata ready, the data is ready to go through a validation step and can be copied to the clipboard in the correct format.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run the app: `npm run dev`
4. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Here are a few ideas for future updates:

- **Auto-suggest existing tags:** Past entries could be read to create a list of existing tags that can be recommended.
- **Address verification:** Verify that the given What3words address definitely exists, avoiding possible typos.
