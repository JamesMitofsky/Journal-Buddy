# 📝 Journal Metadata Formatter

This app streamlines the process of digitizing the metadata associated with my journal entries into a Markdown based solution.

## 📚 Why I Built This App

As someone who loves the kinesthetics of writing by hand, I've spilled a lot of ink writing in my journal. On the other hand, as someone who loves data, I know the my rambly thoughts need to become searchable. The first step down this road is transcription.

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for a while, but reliably typing out the metadata of each entry is a tedious ritual, and that frustration compromises data fidelity and discourages regularly contributing to the transcription.

That's where the Journal Metadata Formatter comes in! By automating the formatting process, it reduces the fuss to focus on what truly matters: capturing thoughts and reflections.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Input:** Enter journal entry details into the app.
2. **Metadata Generation:** The app automatically formats the metadata according to a predefined and versioned structure.
3. **Copy and Paste:** With the formatted metadata ready, the data is ready to go through a validation step and can be copied to the clipboard in the correct format.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run the app: `npm run dev`
4. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Here are a few ideas for future updates:

- **Auto-suggest existing tags:** Past entries on the computer could be read to create a list of existing tags that can be recommended.
- **Auto-suggest existing locations:** Rather than using local storage for past locations, past entries on the computer could be read to create a list of existing tags that can be recommended.
- **Address verification:** Provide a visual verification for the given Plus Code address, making sure it's not in some wildly wrong place.
- **Automate file creation:** Rather than copying the metadata to a file, automate the file creation in a given directory on the user's computer.
